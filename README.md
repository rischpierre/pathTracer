### RoadMap

- #### MVP
- [X] Camera object
- [x] Area square lights
- [x] Shadows
- [x] Smooth shading
- [x] Acceleration structure
- [ ] GI
- [ ] Diffuse shader
- [ ] Multipixel sampling
- [ ] Refraction
- [ ] Reflection
- [ ] SSS
 
- ### Good to have:
- [ ] Rendersettings 
- [ ] Triangulate quads from usd 
- [ ] Add log for the ray intersections
- [ ] Support animation to make a gif for the presentation
- [ ] Make google tests work again
- [ ] Export png
- [ ] Remove cmake warnings

- ### Limitations:
- [ ] BVH the triangles should have roughly the same size
